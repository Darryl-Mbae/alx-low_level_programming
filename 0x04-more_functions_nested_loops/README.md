# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## What is the purpose of a function prototype?
The Function prototype serves the following purposes â€“ 
1) It tells the return type of the data that the function will return. 
2) It tells the number of arguments passed to the function. 
3) It tells the data types of each of the passed arguments. 
4) Also it tells the order in which the arguments are passed to the function.

I found this project to be easy compared to the rest so no much further expalnation

[0-isupper.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/0-isupper.c) ~ The trick here will be in your loop ```if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')``` but also in the standard library ```isupper``` will do run ```man isupper``` to learn more

[1-isdigit.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/1-isdigit.c) ~ Here it important to know if using putchar (characters) it is important to know the ASCII values of numbers ```if (c >= 48 && c <= 57)``` but also in the standard library ```isdigit``` will do. Run ```man isdigit``` to learn more.

[2-mul.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/2-mul.c) ~  function that multiplies two integers.

[3-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/3-print_numbers.c) ~ function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

[4-print_most_numbers.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/4-print_most_numbers.c) ~ function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

[5-more_numbers.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/5-more_numbers.c) ~ function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

[6-print_line.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/6-print_line.c) ~ function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

[7-print_diagonal.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/7-print_diagonal.c) ~ function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

[8-print_square.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/8-print_square.c) ~ function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

[9-fizz_buzz.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/9-fizz_buzz.c) ~ Its an interview question try testing yourself

[10-print_triangle.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/10-print_triangle.c) ~ function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

[100-prime_factor.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/100-prime_factor.c) ~ that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line

[101-print_number.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/101-print_number.c) ~ function that prints an integer.
