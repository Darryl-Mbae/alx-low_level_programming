## Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| + | Adds two operands | A + B = 30 |
| - | Adds two operands |  A âˆ’ B = -10 |
| * | Multiplies both operands. |  A * B = 200 |
| / | Divides numerator by de-numerator. | B / A = 20 |
| % | Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division. | B % A = 0 |
| ++ | Increment operator increases the integer value by one. | i++ |
| -- | Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.. |i-- |

## Explanations 
[0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) ~ This is a C program that generates a random integer using the rand() function from the stdlib.h library and determines if it is positive, negative, or zero using a conditional statement.
> rand() - RAND_MAX / 2 subtracts half of the maximum value from the randomly generated integer. This effectively shifts the range of possible values from being centered around 0 to starting from -RAND_MAX/2. For example, if rand() generates the value 20000 and RAND_MAX is 32767, then rand() - RAND_MAX / 2 would be equal to 20000 - 16383 = 3617.
> The sequence of integers generated by rand() is deterministic and depends on the initial value of the generator, which is called the "seed". By setting the seed with srand(), you can ensure that the sequence of numbers generated by rand() is different each time your program runs.
