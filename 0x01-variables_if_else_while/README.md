## Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| + | Adds two operands | A + B = 30 |
| - | Adds two operands |  A − B = -10 |
| * | Multiplies both operands. |  A * B = 200 |
| / | Divides numerator by de-numerator. | B / A = 20 |
| % | Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division. | B % A = 0 |
| ++ | Increment operator increases the integer value by one. | i++ |
| -- | Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.. |i-- |

## Relationl Operations
| Operator	| Description	| Example |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| ==	| Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.	| (A == B) is not true. |
| != | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.	| (A != B) is true. |
| > | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. |	(A > B) is not true. |
| <	| Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. |	(A < B) is true. |
| >= | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.	| (A >= B) is not true. |
| <= | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.	| (A <= B) is true. |

## Logical Operators
| Operators | Example | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| && (logical AND) | (x>5)&&(y<5) | It returns true when both conditions are true |
| \|\| (logical OR) | (x>=10)\|\|(y>=10) | It returns true when at-least one of the condition is true |
| ! (logical NOT) | !((x>5)&&(y<5)) | It reverses the state of the operand “((x>5) && (y<5))” <br> If “((x>5) && (y<5))” is true, logical NOT operator makes it false |

## Explanations 
[0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) ~ This is a C program that generates a random integer using the rand() function from the stdlib.h library and determines if it is positive, negative, or zero using a conditional statement.
> rand() - RAND_MAX / 2 subtracts half of the maximum value from the randomly generated integer. This effectively shifts the range of possible values from being centered around 0 to starting from -RAND_MAX/2. For example, if rand() generates the value 20000 and RAND_MAX is 32767, then rand() - RAND_MAX / 2 would be equal to 20000 - 16383 = 3617.

> The sequence of integers generated by rand() is deterministic and depends on the initial value of the generator, which is called the "seed". By setting the seed with srand(), you can ensure that the sequence of numbers generated by rand() is different each time your program runs.

[1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) ~ This is a C program that generates a random integer n and prints information about its last digit.
> The program then uses the modulus operator (%) to get the last digit of n by taking the remainder when n is divided by 10. This is done using the expression n % 10.

> The program then uses a series of if/else if statements to print information about the last digit of n. If the last digit is greater than 5, the program prints a message saying so. If the last digit is equal to 0, the program prints a different message. Otherwise, the program prints a third message indicating that the last digit is less than 6 and not 0.

[2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) ```for (letter = 'a'; letter <= 'z'; letter++)``` This C program prints all lowercase letters of the English alphabet in a single line, separated by no spaces.

[3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c) ~ Writes a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
```
for (letter = 'a'; letter <= 'z'; letter++)
	{
		putchar(toupper(letter));
	}
  ```
[4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c) ~ Writes a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.Print all the letters except q and e.

[5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c) ~ Writes a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

[6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c) ~ Writes a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
> putchar can be used to display integers in C, but it requires additional steps to convert the integer to a character before it can be displayed.

[7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c) ```for (letter = 'z'; letter >= 'a'; letter--)``` Writes a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

[8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)
> In computer science, base 16 is a commonly used numeral system that is also known as hexadecimal. The base 16 system uses 16 distinct symbols to represent numbers: the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F (or a-f) are used to represent the values 10 to 15.We use the condition i < 10 in the for loop to differentiate between digits and letters.

> When i is less than 10, we know that we are dealing with a digit and we can print it directly using the %d format specifier. However, when i is 10 or greater, we know that we are dealing with a letter, and we need to convert the numeric value to its corresponding character value using the expression ('a' + i - 10).

[9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/Darryl-Mbae/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c) ~ Writes a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers like this 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
