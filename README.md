# Alx low level programmning

First do yo know why we use gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* -Wall: Enables a set of warning messages that catch common programming errors and potential issues. It stands for "all warnings."

* -Werror: Treats all warnings as errors. When enabled, any warning generated by the compiler will cause the compilation process to fail. This flag helps enforce a policy of zero tolerance for warnings.

* -Wextra: Enables additional warning messages beyond those enabled by -Wall. It provides more comprehensive coverage of potential issues and coding practices that may lead to errors.

* -pedantic: Enforces strict adherence to the standard specified by the C programming language. It disables certain language extensions and raises warnings for non-standard or potentially problematic code constructs.

* -std=gnu89: Specifies the C language standard to be used during compilation. In this case, it indicates the use of the GNU C dialect with some extensions from the C89 (ANSI C) standard. This flag is specifically used to select the C language version and its associated features.
