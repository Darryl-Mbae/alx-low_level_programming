# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## What is the purpose of a function prototype?
The Function prototype serves the following purposes â€“ 
1) It tells the return type of the data that the function will return. 
2) It tells the number of arguments passed to the function. 
3) It tells the data types of each of the passed arguments. 
4) Also it tells the order in which the arguments are passed to the function.
