# Recursion
Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
```
void recursion() {
   recursion(); /* function calls itself */
}

int main() {
   recursion();
}
```
Recursion is useful in situations where a problem can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems. It is particularly handy for tasks such as tree traversal, searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), mathematical operations (e.g., factorial), and problems that exhibit a divide-and-conquer pattern.

However, there are scenarios where recursion may not be the best choice:

* Performance concerns: Recursive solutions can be less efficient than iterative approaches due to the overhead of function calls and maintaining call stack frames.
* Stack overflow: Recursive functions can consume a significant amount of stack memory if the recursion depth is too large, potentially leading to a stack overflow error.
* Complex logic: Sometimes, using iteration or a straightforward iterative algorithm can result in clearer and more readable code compared to recursive solutions.
* Resource limitations: Recursive algorithms may not be suitable when resources like time or memory are constrained, as they can potentially lead to excessive resource usage.
